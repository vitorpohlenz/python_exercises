# Python Exercises on Functions, Generators, Mutable and Immutable Objects

## 1. Function to Calculate the Average
Create a function that receives a list of numbers and returns their average;

## 2. Function to Check Palindrome
Create a function that receives a string and returns True if it is a palindrome, and False otherwise;

Write a generator function for the Fibonacci sequence with n elements;

## 12. Function for Argument Unpacking
Create a function that receives a variable number of arguments and returns their sum;

## 13. Using *args and **kwargs
Write a function that uses *args to receive numbers and **kwargs to receive an operator (+, -, *, /) and perform the desired operation;

## 14. Using the Built-in sorted Function
Use the sorted function to sort a list of strings by length;

## 15. Using the Built-in zip Function
Write a program that combines two lists of the same number of elements into pairs using the zip function;

## 16. Function that Modifies a List
Write a function that receives a list and adds an element to it. Test with mutable lists and with a tuple, and observe the behavior;
