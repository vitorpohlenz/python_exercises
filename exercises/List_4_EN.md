# Exercises with Numpy: Arrays, ndarrays, and Matrix Operations

## 1. Creation of a 1D Array
Create a one-dimensional (1D) array containing the numbers from 0 to 9 using Numpy. Display the array and its type;

## 2. Creation of a 2D Array
Create a two-dimensional (2D) 3x3 array with values from 1 to 9 using Numpy. Display the matrix and its dimensions;

## 3. Array Addition Operation
Create two 1D arrays of size 5, containing random integers between 1 and 10. Perform the sum between these arrays, ensuring that the same random numbers are used regardless of how many times the code is executed;

## 4. Elementary Mathematical Operations
Given a 1D array of integers from 1 to 5, calculate the square of each element using Numpy operations;

## 5. Matrix Multiplication
Create two 3x3 matrices of random numbers and compute the matrix product between them using Numpy’s `dot()` method. Also, use the `*` operator and notice the difference;

## 6. Matrix Transposition
Create a 4x3 matrix of random numbers and compute its transpose using Numpy;

## 7. Usual Inner Product
What happens if you use the `.dot()` operator or `@` between two arrays of the same size? And between a matrix and an array? Remember to respect the coherence between the number of matrix dimensions and array elements;

## 8. Array Reshaping
Create a 1D array containing 12 numbers and reshape it into a 3x4 matrix;

## 9. Indexing and Slicing
Given a 5x5 matrix of random numbers, extract the 2x2 submatrix located in the upper right corner;

## 10. Logical Operations
Create a 1D array of 10 random integers. Check which elements are greater than 5 and display the result as a boolean array and also show the values greater than 5;

## 11. Mean and Standard Deviation Calculation
Given a 4x4 matrix of random integers, calculate the mean and standard deviation using all the elements;

## 12. Matrices of Zeros and Ones
Create a 5x5 matrix of zeros and another of ones using Numpy’s `zeros()` and `ones()` methods;

## 13. Array Concatenation
Create two 1D arrays of size 3 and concatenate them both horizontally and vertically;

## 14. Generation of Linspace
Use the `linspace()` method to generate an array of 10 equally spaced elements between 0 and 1. Display the array;

## 15. Matrix Diagonal Extraction
Given a 4x4 matrix of random numbers, extract the elements from the main diagonal using Numpy’s `diag()` method;
