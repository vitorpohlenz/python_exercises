# Exercises with Matplotlib and SciPy

## 1. Creating a Simple Line Plot
Using Matplotlib, create a line plot for the x values from 0 to 10 and y as the square of x. Add labels to the axes and a title to the plot;

## 2. Bar Chart
Using Matplotlib, create a bar chart to represent a store's sales over 5 months. Use a list of months on the x-axis and a list of sales on the y-axis;

## 3. Scatter Plot
Create a scatter plot with 50 random points using `numpy` to generate the x and y values. Use Matplotlib to plot and set colors for the points;

## 4. Histogram
Generate 1000 random numbers with a normal distribution using `numpy` and create a histogram using Matplotlib. Set the number of bins to 30;

## 5. Subplots in One Figure
Using Matplotlib, create two subplots in a single window. The first should be a line plot, and the second, a bar chart;

## 6. Pie Chart
Using Matplotlib, create a pie chart to display the market share of five different products. Add labels to the slices and highlight the largest slice;

## 7. Sine and Cosine Functions
Using Matplotlib, plot the sine and cosine functions on the same graph. Add a legend to identify each function and differentiate them by color;

## 8. Curve Fitting with SciPy
Using the `curve_fit` function from the SciPy library, fit a curve to data generated by the function `y = 2x + 3` with random noise. Plot both the data and the fitted curve;

## 9. Solving Differential Equations
Using `odeint` from SciPy, solve the simple differential equation `dy/dx = -2y`, where `y(0) = 1`. Plot the solution for `y` as a function of `x` from 0 to 5;

## 10. Fourier Transform
Using SciPy, apply the Fourier transform to a simple signal like `sin(x)` and plot the resulting frequency spectrum using Matplotlib;

## 11. Data Interpolation
Using the `interp1d` function from SciPy, perform linear interpolation on a set of 5 data points. Plot both the original data and the interpolated curve using Matplotlib;

## 12. Numerical Integration
Use the `quad` function from SciPy to integrate the function `f(x) = x^2` over the interval from 0 to 3. Display the result of the integration;

## 13. Contour Plot
Create a contour plot using Matplotlib for the function `z = sin(x) * cos(y)`, where `x` and `y` vary from -5 to 5. Add a color bar next to the plot;

## 14. Density Plot
Using Matplotlib, create a density plot to represent 1000 randomly generated points with a normal distribution in two dimensions;

## 15. Solving Linear Systems
Using `linalg.solve` from SciPy, solve the following linear system and display the solution with the resulting vector in a Matplotlib plot.
$$
2x + y = 3 \\
x - y = 1
$$
